Focusing on reducing the wet lab costs of vaccine research, I utilized the NetMHCIIpan-4.3 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict immune triggering peptides in Tuberculosis antigens, focusing on the binding pattern with MHC II. I processed large scale sequencing data and validated the model's predictions against experimental results using R² correlation and Jaccard similarity, demonstrating the effectiveness of computational methods in identifying potential vaccine candidates.
