Addressing the limitations of existing genomic tools, I developed Nanophaser, a specialized Python package for analyzing DNA sequencing data. This tool was optimized for MinION sequencing technology to identify genetic variants and perform haplotype phasing at multi-allelic loci. By creating a robust pipeline for allele classification, I provided researchers with a more accurate method for characterizing complex immune system genes.
