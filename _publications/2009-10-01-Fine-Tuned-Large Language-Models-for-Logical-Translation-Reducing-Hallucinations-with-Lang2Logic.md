**Abstract:**
This presentation explores the intersection of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

 It discusses a novel framework for translating natural language sentences into logical expressions and subsequently into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving. The talk highlights the use of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce hallucinations in this translation process, enabling more reliable automated reasoning for applications in software verification and debugging. The presentation covers the background of propositional logic, the challenges of LLM hallucinations, and future directions involving SMT solvers and multi-language support.
