To address the unreliability of Large Language Models in formal reasoning, I developed 'Lang2Logic', a framework that accurately translates natural language into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for automated theorem proving. I fine-tuned LLMs and constrained their outputs using a custom-defined grammar and symbolic computation libraries, successfully creating a pipeline that significantly reduces hallucinations and enables reliable SAT solving for software verification tasks.
