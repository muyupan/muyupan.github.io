title: "Dynamic Memory Allocator & Virtual Manager"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/c-lang.png' style='float: left; width: 100px; margin-right: 20px; height: auto;'><br><b>Time:</b> Spring 2024 <br> <b>Location:</b> Penn State University <br> <b>Advisor:</b> Coursework <br> <b>Skills:</b> C, Systems Programming, Algorithms <br><br> I engineered a custom dynamic memory allocator (malloc/free) utilizing Buddy System and Slab Allocation algorithms to optimize heap management. Additionally, I built a virtual memory manager that intercepted SIGSEGV signals to handle demand paging, implementing FIFO and Third Chance page replacement policies. This system effectively minimized internal fragmentation and page faults in a simulated resource-constrained environment."
