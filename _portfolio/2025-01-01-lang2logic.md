To address the unreliability of Large Language Models in formal reasoning, I developed 'Lang2Logic', a framework that translates natural language into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for automated theorem proving. I fine tuned LLMs and constrained their outputs using a custom defined grammar and symbolic computation libraries, successfully creating a pipeline that significantly reduces hallucinations and enables the expansion of SAT solver domains from logical verification to finance, healthcare, and other fields.
