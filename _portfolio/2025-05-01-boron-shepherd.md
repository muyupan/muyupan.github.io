title: "Boron Shepherd: Diffusion for Drug Design"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/diffusion.png' style='float: left; width: 100px; margin-right: 20px; height: auto;'><br><b>Time:</b> 2024 - Present <br> <b>Location:</b> Penn State University <br> <b>Advisor:</b> Prof. Mahfuza Farooque <br> <b>Skills:</b> PyTorch, Diffusion Models, Molecular Design <br><br> This project explores the application of the Shepherd diffusion model to the specialized domain of Boron-containing drug design. By adapting diffusion architectures to account for the unique electrostatic and shape properties of Boron, I aim to generate novel molecular structures that optimize pharmacophore matching, facilitating the discovery of bioisosteric drug candidates with enhanced therapeutic potential."
