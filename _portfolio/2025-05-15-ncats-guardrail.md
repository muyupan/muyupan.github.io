I developed a robust hallucination guardrail system for the NCATS (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences) Translator Summarizer. This system is designed to verify and constrain the outputs of Large Language Models when summarizing complex biomedical data, ensuring that the generated insights are factually grounded and free from fabrications, thereby increasing trust in AI-assisted translational science.
