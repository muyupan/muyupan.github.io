title: "Pipelined MIPS CPU Simulation"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/cpu.png' style='float: left; width: 100px; margin-right: 20px; height: auto;'><br><b>Time:</b> Fall 2024 <br> <b>Location:</b> Penn State University <br> <b>Advisor:</b> Coursework <br> <b>Skills:</b> Verilog, Computer Architecture <br><br> I designed and simulated a fully functional 32-bit MIPS CPU using Verilog. The architecture featured a 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) and included advanced hazard detection units and data forwarding mechanisms to resolve dependencies. The final design successfully executed complex sequences of arithmetic, logical, memory, and branch instructions without deadlocks, demonstrating a deep understanding of hardware-level parallel processing."
