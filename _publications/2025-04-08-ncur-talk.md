<!-- ## Abstract
This presentation explores the intersection of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It discusses a novel framework for translating natural language sentences into logical expressions and subsequently into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving. The talk highlights the use of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce hallucinations in this translation process, enabling more reliable automated reasoning for applications in software verification and debugging.

**Presentation Details:**
* **Type:** Oral Presentation
