Hi, I am Muyu Pan, a senior CS undergraduate student at Penn State University, advised by Dr. [Rui Zhang](https://ryanzhumich.github.io/). I am passionate about research on Science for AI and AI for Science. I am also a [Schreyer Honors Scholar](https://www.shc.psu.edu/).

<span style="color: red;">I am applying for a PhD position starting in Fall 2026 to advance my research on AI safety and AI for Science domains. I actively seek opportunities in this area and welcome any related information or openings.</span>

I am also open to academic collaborationsâ€”please feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together! Let's build the future of LLMs together!

Research
======
I am actively pursuing research on developing robust language models with minimal hallucination tendencies and advanced reasoning capabilities to facilitate automated scientific discovery. My work aims to contribute to the development of <span style="color: red;">artificial general intelligence in scientific domains</span> (e.g., biomedical research), focusing on systems capable of solving expert-level problems across disciplines.

I am interested in the following research topics:

- **Hallucination detection and mitigation**
- **Trustworthy, robust Large Language Model systems**
- **Reasoning-Intensive Scientific Discovery**

And to answer the following research questions:

1. How can we minimize hallucination within the large languae models(LLM), to make LLM truestworth for scientific discovery usage?
2. How can we leverage collaborative LLM frameworks to enhance complex reasoning and improve robustness in critical decision-making scenarios?
3. How can we build autonomous AI systems that accelerate scientific discovery while preserving interpretability and scientific rigor?


News
======
