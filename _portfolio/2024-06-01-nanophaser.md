title: "Nanophaser: Bioinformatics Python Package"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/python-pkg.png' style='float: left; width: 100px; margin-right: 20px; height: auto;'><br><b>Time:</b> 2023 - 2024 <br> <b>Location:</b> Penn State University <br> <b>Advisor:</b> Prof. István Albert <br> <b>Skills:</b> Python, Bioinformatics, Algorithm Design <br><br> addressing the limitations of existing genomic tools, I developed Nanophaser, a specialized Python package for analyzing DNA sequencing data. This tool was optimized for MinION sequencing technology to identify genetic variants and perform haplotype phasing at multi-allelic loci. By creating a robust pipeline for allele classification, I provided researchers with a more accurate method for characterizing complex immune system genes."
